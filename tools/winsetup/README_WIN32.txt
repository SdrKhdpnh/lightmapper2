If you don't already have them (for example from Visual C++ 2005 or the .NET 2.0 runtime), you can get the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)" from Microsoft (approx. 2.6MB)

This software requires a registry key to find its shared libraries, some other software may use it too for automatic configuration.
Please do not instruct your antivirus, antispyware or similar software to block this entry, otherwise things will not work.
