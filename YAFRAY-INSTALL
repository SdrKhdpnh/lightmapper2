This software uses SCons (http://www.scons.org) as build system for
all supported platforms.
Please make sure you have SCons 0.97 or later, or at very least one
of the later 0.97 prerelease (0.96.93 etc.)
0.96.1 is DEFINITELY TOO OLD

Note: several header files are automatically created by the build process
If you have problems after updating or changing options, try to remove
the file "yafray_config.h" (it's for some advanced settings normal users
probably don't want to touch), because this file is not overwritten
automatically!

----- DEPENDENCIES -----

YafRay requires a couple of additional packages to enable all features.
These are currently:

zlib:        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
libpng:      http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/
libjpeg:     http://www.ijg.org/
OpenEXR:     http://openexr.com/
libxml2:     http://xmlsoft.org/
freetype2:   http://www.freetype.org/
pthread:     (win32) http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

Pre-built libraries for Win32/MSVC8 are available in the svn dir 'libs'
Note that there is no guarantee YafRay will build with some libraries
disabled, some code sections may not be disabled automatically yet, or
the library is even mandatory (e.g. pthread).

----- OPTIONS -----

The recommended way to change options is to override settings
in 'user-config.py'. You have to create this file (in the dir
as the SConstruct, NOT config/user-config.py)
Do NOT edit the files in config/, this asks for conficts with SVN!

A couple of useful settings:
- enable/disable libraries (e.g. YF_WITH_FREETYPE = 'false')
- change include/library paths (YF_PNG_INC, YF_PNG_LIBPATH etc.)
- change installation dirs: e.g. PREFIX = '/opt'
  note: YF_LIBOUT usually needs to be known to the dynamic linker
- change compiler flags: CCFLAGS, REL_CCFLAGS, DEBUG_CCFLAGS
- do debug build: YF_DEBUG = 'true'
  note: you may want to set DEBUG_CCFLAGS and link against
        debug libraries instead

To install (*n*x) do 'scons install' or 'sudo scons install' in case
you're a sudoer.
If you chose an install dir outside the source tree, you may have
to do 'scons install' on windows too, but note that YafRay still requires
a registry key to find its paths in Windows, whereas the default paths
are hard-coded on other platforms.
